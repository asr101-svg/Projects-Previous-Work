  Project: Lab Assignment 2 Script (Iteration 0)
  Date of Last Update: Jan 25, 2024.

  Functional Summary
      find_first_names.py takes in a CSV (comma separated version) file, as well as a file only consisting of names
      and prints out the names from the file consisting only of names with whether or not the name was found.
      If the name is found, it will print the line number or "ranking".
      If it is not found, it will print 0 beside the name.

      There are expected to be three fields:
          1. name
          2. sex (only F or M recorded in this US census data)
          3. number of people with this name

      The file represents the names of people in the population
      for a particular year of birth in the United States of America.
      Officially it is the "National Data on the relative frequency
      of given names in the population of U.S. births where the individual
      has a Social Security Number".

     Commandline Parameters: 2
        argv[1] = name of the input file containing the names
        argv[2] = name of the input file containing the names to search for

# The 'sys' module gives us access to system tools, including the
# command line parameters, as well as standard input, output and error
import sys

# The 'csv' module gives us access to a tool that will read CSV
# (Comma Separated Value) files and provide us access to each of
# the fields on each line in turn
import csv

#
# Define any "constants" for the file here.
# Names of constants should be in UPPER_CASE.
