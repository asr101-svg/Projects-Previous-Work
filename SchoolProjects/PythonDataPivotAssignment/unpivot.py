  Functional Summary
      unpivot.py takes a table and unpivots it based on the given arguments

      The file represents the names of people in the population
      for a particular year of birth in the United States of America.
      Officially it is the "National Data on the relative frequency
      of given names in the population of U.S. births where the individual
      has a Social Security Number".

     Commandline Parameters: 2
        argv[1] = name of the input file containing the names
        argv[2] = The N amount you want to pivot by
        argv[3] = Header name for start of the row
        argv[4] = Cell value name for start of the row

# The 'sys' module gives us access to system tools, including the

# (Comma Separated Value) files and provide us access to each of
# the fields on each line in turn
import csv

#
# Define any "constants" for the file here.
# Names of constants should be in UPPER_CASE.
